- Start with a beeline for target, a basic plan.
  First implement game core, then extra elements.
- This is a start, the end depends on you ;)

* (programming) Language

- Python: simple, yet extensive, plenty of resources & references
- C/C++: numerous resources & references
- A bunch of other languages

* Scope

- Build up some experience first.
- Go through the entire dev process at least once or twice before
  starting larger serious projects.
- Keep your scope small at first.
  - focus on the main path first
  - to have a complete thing to show for your efforts

* Core Mechanic

- What is needed at least to make your roguelike fun?
- What is unique?
  
* 7DRL (7-days roguelike)

- Not your first game, but recommended when you have at least some experience,
  having a deadline really does help.
- "start small and expand as necessary after you’ve confirmed
  your core mechanic seems like a good idea."

* Good Starting Points

- Attract others, hooks
  - core mechanic, replayability
  - audiovisual features
  - theme
    
* Theme

- historical, mythological
- sci-fi
- ...

* XRLs

- Base on existing IPs

- /be careful of particularly litigious companies/
- RLs are niche and under radar, fine for hobby projects
- Only those earning great profits would have to worry about
  this sort of things.
  - But by that time you can either rebrand it to your own content,
    or should probably have enough experience to be comfortable
    working on your own ideas from scratch.
- *In any case, definitely forget having any commercial aspirations
  with an existing IP!*

  
* Tips for the Lone Run

** Release Early and Often
  
- "minimal playable state"

** Keep a Blog

- organize your thoughts
- examine your work from a different angle
- document the process
- create a useful long-term reference
- get feedback
- build a community
  
** Accessibility

- Mouse support
- Better looking

* Comments

- 了解新框架时, 随便试试也是有趣的过程
  - 可能在主路径上开发和在测试项目中随意的探索能相辅相成吧
